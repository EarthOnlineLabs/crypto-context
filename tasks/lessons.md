## 2026-05-27: Wallet Portfolio Fetch on Vercel Serverless

### Problem
Wallet data not appearing in portfolio context. Multiple cascading issues.

### Root Causes & Fixes

1. **`{ next: { revalidate: 300 } }` is invalid in Route Handlers**
   - Only works in Server Components. In Route Handlers it causes fetch to fail silently.
   - Fix: Use `{ cache: 'no-store', signal: AbortSignal.timeout(ms) }` instead.

2. **Viem's default public RPCs are unreliable from Vercel**
   - `http()` with no URL uses chain defaults (Cloudflare for Ethereum) which timeout from cloud IPs.
   - Ankr public RPCs now require API keys (changed since 2025).
   - Fix: Use explicit `PublicNode` RPC URLs (`https://ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com`, etc.) — free, no API key, ~1.5s response.

3. **Sequential fetches cause 504 on Vercel**
   - Exchange fetch + wallet fetch in sequential for-loops exceeds Vercel function timeout.
   - Even `maxDuration: 60` isn't enough if individual operations are slow.
   - Fix: Use `Promise.all` for all independent operations (exchange fetches, wallet fetches, getBalance + multicall).

4. **Dashboard should never block on slow API calls**
   - `await fetchPortfolio()` in `init()` prevents the entire dashboard from rendering.
   - Fix: Set `loading = false` before starting portfolio fetch. Fire-and-forget the fetch; portfolio section appears when data arrives.

5. **Always use per-source timeouts for aggregation endpoints**
   - A single slow/failing source shouldn't block the entire response.
   - Fix: Wrap each data source fetch in a `withTimeout` helper that returns null on timeout. Return partial results with error metadata.

### Pattern: Reliable External Data Fetching on Vercel Serverless
```
1. Use explicit RPC URLs (never rely on library defaults)
2. Set aggressive timeouts (5s for RPC, 5s for CoinGecko)
3. Parallelize all independent operations
4. Add per-source timeout wrappers
5. Return partial results on failure
6. Make UI non-blocking — show structure first, data later
```

## 2026-05-28: MCP Registration in Claude Code

### Problem
User had an MCP token in the dashboard but assumed the MCP was already connected to Claude Code. It was not — having a token ≠ having the MCP registered.

### Key Insight
MCP token is the "key", but it still needs to be registered in Claude Code via `claude mcp add`. These are two separate steps:
1. **Generate token** — done in the CryptoContext dashboard (creates auth credential)
2. **Register MCP** — done via CLI `claude mcp add` (tells Claude Code where the server is and how to authenticate)

### Registration Command
```bash
claude mcp add -t http -s user \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
  -- crypto-ctx https://app-rho-jet-70.vercel.app/api/mcp
```

### Gotcha: Tools not available mid-session
MCP tools are loaded at **session startup**. If you register a new MCP mid-session, the tools won't appear until the next session. Workaround: call the MCP endpoint directly via curl/JSON-RPC 2.0 for immediate testing.

### Pattern: MCP Deployment Checklist
```
1. Deploy MCP endpoint (JSON-RPC 2.0)
2. Generate auth token in dashboard
3. Register with `claude mcp add` (user scope for personal, project scope for team)
4. Verify: `claude mcp list` → should show ✓ Connected
5. Start new session to get tools loaded
6. Test: call get_portfolio / get_context from Claude Code
```

## 2026-06-12: Turbopack Stale CSS After Editing globals.css

### Problem
After rewriting `globals.css` (new custom classes) and starting `next dev`, the served CSS contained the OLD custom classes but none of the new ones — while JSX changes WERE picked up. No build errors anywhere.

### Root Cause
Next 16 dev (Turbopack) reused a stale on-disk cache in `.next/` from a previous session; CSS chunks didn't invalidate.

### Fix / Pattern
1. Symptom check: in DevTools, scan `document.styleSheets` for a new class name — 0 hits while old custom classes match → stale compiled CSS, not a code bug.
2. Stop the dev server, delete the `.next` directory (use a relative path from the app dir — the safety hook blocks absolute-path recursive deletes), restart.
3. Headless-preview gotcha: programmatic scroll + screenshot can capture an unpainted (white) frame; instead resize the viewport tall (e.g. 1440x4900) and capture the whole page in one frame.

## 2026-06-12: Never Hand-Draw Third-Party Brand Logos

### Problem
Hand-drew "simplified" SVG marks for exchange/wallet brands (approximated geometry + official colors). User immediately read them as counterfeit ("纯山寨") — worse for trust than plain letter tiles.

### Rule
For ANY third-party brand mark: use the real, authoritative asset, never a redrawing.
Authoritative sources that work:
- Tokens/coins + exchanges: CoinGecko asset CDN (assets.coingecko.com) — official logos, uniform sizing
- Wallet apps / projects: the org's own GitHub avatar (github.com/{org}.png?size=128) or official brand-kit repos
- Chains: native-token logo by convention; base-org avatar for Base
Bundle them locally (public/) so there is no runtime third-party dependency. Letter tiles are the only acceptable fallback for unknown ids. Own-brand marks (our logo) are the only thing we draw ourselves.
